[x] ignoreInvalidOptionsSwitches - Ignore Invalid Options/Switches - If a switch or option is passed that is not recognized, should choco fail? Available in 0.9.10+.
[x] usePackageExitCodes - Use Package Exit Codes - Package scripts can provide exit codes. With this on, package exit codes will be what choco uses for exit when non-zero (this value can come from a dependency package). Chocolatey defines valid exit codes as 0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1 (matching previous behavior). Available in 0.9.10+.
[ ] useEnhancedExitCodes - Use Enhanced Exit Codes - Chocolatey is able to provide enhanced exit codes surrounding list, search, info, outdated and other commands that don't deal directly with package operations. To see enhanced exit codes and their meanings, please run `choco [cmdname] -?`. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1  (matching previous behavior). Available in 0.10.12+.
[ ] exitOnRebootDetected - Exit On Reboot Detected - Stop running install, upgrade, or uninstall when a reboot request is detected. Requires 'usePackageExitCodes' feature to be turned on. Will exit with either 350 or 1604. When it exits with 350, it means pending reboot discovered prior to running operation. When it exits with 1604, it means some work completed prior to reboot request being detected. Available in 0.10.12+.
[ ] useFipsCompliantChecksums - Use FIPS Compliant Checksums - Ensure checksumming done by choco uses FIPS compliant algorithms. Not recommended unless required by FIPS Mode. Enabling on an existing installation could have unintended consequences related to upgrades/uninstalls. Available in 0.9.10+.
[x] showNonElevatedWarnings - Show Non-Elevated Warnings - Display non-elevated warnings. Available in 0.10.4+.
[x] showDownloadProgress - Show Download Progress - Show download progress percentages in the CLI. Available in 0.10.4+.
[ ] stopOnFirstPackageFailure - Stop On First Package Failure - Stop running install, upgrade or uninstall on first package failure instead of continuing with others. As this will affect upgrade all, it is normally recommended to leave this off. Available in 0.10.4+.
[ ] useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades - Use Remembered Arguments For Upgrades - When running upgrades, use arguments for upgrade that were used for installation ('remembered'). This is helpful when running upgrade for all packages. Available in 0.10.4+. This is considered in preview for 0.10.4 and will be flipped to on by default in a future release.
[ ] ignoreUnfoundPackagesOnUpgradeOutdated - Ignore Unfound Packages On Upgrade Outdated - When checking outdated or upgrades, if a package is not found against sources specified, don't report the package at all. Available in 0.10.9+.
[ ] skipPackageUpgradesWhenNotInstalled - Skip Packages Not Installed During Upgrade - if a package is not installed, do not install it during the upgrade process. Available in 0.10.12+.

[ ] logWithoutColor - Log without color - Do not show colorization in logging output. Available in 0.10.9+.
[x] logValidationResultsOnWarnings - Log validation results on warnings - Should the validation results be logged if there are warnings? Available in 0.10.12+.
[x] usePackageRepositoryOptimizations - Use Package Repository Optimizations - Turn on optimizations for reducing bandwidth with repository queries during package install/upgrade/outdated operations. Should generally be left enabled, unless a repository needs to support older methods of query. When disabled, this makes queries similar to the way they were done in Chocolatey v0.10.11 and before. Available in 0.10.14+.
[ ] scriptsCheckLastExitCode - Scripts Check $LastExitCode (external commands) - Leave this off unless you absolutely need it while you fix your package scripts  to use `throw 'error message'` or `Set-PowerShellExitCode #` instead of `exit #`. This behavior started in 0.9.10 and produced hard to find bugs. If the last external process exits successfully but with an exit code of not zero, this could cause hard to detect package failures. Available in 0.10.3+. Will be removed in 0.11.0.
